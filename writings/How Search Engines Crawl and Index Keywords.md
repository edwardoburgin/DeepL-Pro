## What Is Indexing?

When you search for a keyword on Amazon, the results appear almost instantly. Many believe these results are generated in real-time, but that's not the case. Search results are pre-processed through a step called **indexing**. 

Search engines cannot directly use raw web pages for ranking purposes due to the complexity and volume of data. Amazon, for instance, processes billions of pages, making real-time crawling impractical. Instead, indexing enables pre-processing of keyword data to ensure quick retrieval and ranking.

## How Amazonâ€™s Search Engine Indexes Keywords

### 1. Crawling Text Information
Amazonâ€™s **web crawler**, often referred to as a spider, scrapes the text information from pages. These pages also include front-end elements like HTML code and formatting tags. The crawler eliminates non-text elements to extract pure textual content.

For example, on a product page, the crawler may retain only critical text such as:  
`"Certified Refurbished Amazon Echo (1st Generation)"`.

Additionally, any keywords emphasized using tags like `<b>` or `<strong>` are given extra importance by the crawler.

### 2. Removing Stop Words
Not all words are valuable for indexing. Common stop words like *the*, *a*, *of*, *this*, or frequently repeated words in navigation bars are excluded. Removing these irrelevant terms reduces clutter and improves indexing efficiency.

### 3. Two-Step Indexing Process
#### **Step 1: Initial Indexing**
Each page is initially indexed as a collection of keywords. However, this index cannot directly serve search queries because searching through every indexed page for a match would still be too slow.

#### **Step 2: Reverse Indexing**
In this step, the relationship between keywords and pages is reversed. Instead of searching for pages containing a keyword, the index maps keywords to relevant pages. This reverse mapping significantly accelerates the search process, allowing Amazon to deliver results almost instantly.

This process also incorporates the **listing weight**, a factor critical for ranking results.

## What Kind of Keywords Do You Need?

A common concern is dealing with the large volume of keywords generated during optimization. Itâ€™s essential to prioritize **core keywords** that are directly relevant to your products. Here's how different languages handle keyword optimization:

- **Chinese Search Engines**: Chinese requires "word segmentation" because there are no spaces between words. This technique identifies meaningful phrases within a string of characters.
- **English Search Engines**: English search engines donâ€™t need segmentation because words are already separated by spaces. Additionally, search engines automatically generate keyword combinations. For example:
  - The phrase "Amazon Echo Dot 2nd Generation" is treated as individual keywords: *Amazon*, *Echo*, *Dot*, *2nd*, *Generation*.
  - Customers searching for "Echo Dot 2" will still find your product, as the engine combines relevant terms.

### Ensuring Comprehensive Keyword Coverage
To optimize your listings:
- Include **every core keyword** in your title and product description.
- Avoid worrying about keyword phrases; search engines will create combinations automatically.
- Focus on listing all essential terms to ensure maximum visibility in search results.

## Summary

Amazonâ€™s indexing process ensures lightning-fast search results by pre-processing and mapping keywords to pages. Understanding this process allows sellers to optimize their listings effectively by:
- Focusing on core keywords.
- Prioritizing listing weight for better ranking.
- Avoiding unnecessary keyword phrases, as engines automatically handle combinations.

Implement these strategies, and let Amazonâ€™s algorithm work to make your products more discoverable.
