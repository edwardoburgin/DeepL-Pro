## What Is Google SERP?

Google SERP is the results page that appears when users perform a search on Google. It typically lists links to web pages relevant to the userâ€™s query, along with properties like the title, URL, and meta description. SERPs may also display ads, knowledge panels, and related questions to enhance the userâ€™s search experience.

Achieving a top-10 position on the SERPs is critical for websites seeking to increase organic traffic. However, manually monitoring your rankings on Google can be challenging due to limitations and restrictions. Thatâ€™s where a tool like **Outscraper** comes in handy, offering the ability to scrape and track rankings without limits.
