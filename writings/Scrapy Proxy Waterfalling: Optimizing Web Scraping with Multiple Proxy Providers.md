# Scrapy Proxy Waterfalling: Optimizing Web Scraping with Multiple Proxy Providers

## Introduction

A common challenge for web scrapers is designing a reliable system to handle requests across multiple proxy providers. This approach, often referred to as **proxy waterfalling**, helps increase reliability while reducing costs.

Proxies can be unpredictableâ€”what works today might fail tomorrow. Their performance and cost can vary widely, making it crucial to have a robust system that distributes requests intelligently among various proxy providers.

This guide explains how to build a **custom proxy waterfalling middleware** for Scrapy, a popular Python web scraping framework. Let's dive in.

## Proxy Waterfalling Strategy

Your proxy waterfalling strategy can be tailored to meet specific needs. For this guide, we focus on the following key objectives:

1. **Start without a proxy**: Save on costs by making the first request proxy-free.
2. **Prioritize cheaper proxies**: Use the least expensive functional proxy for a website.
3. **Improve reliability**: Fall back to more reliable (but costlier) proxies when cheaper options fail.
4. **Site-specific proxies**: Assign specific proxies to specific websites.

### Key Features to Expand On
You can extend your middleware to:
- Customize proxy parameters (e.g., geotargeting, JavaScript rendering) based on request flags.
- Rotate user-agents dynamically.
- Validate responses on the fly.

### Proxy Providers Used in This Guide
We'll work with three proxy providers:
1. [ScraperAPI](https://www.scraperapi.com/?fp_ref=coupons)
2. Scrapingdog
3. ScrapingBee

## Building the Proxy Waterfall Middleware

To create the middleware, we'll define a **DownloaderMiddleware** in the `middleware.py` file. Follow these steps to build it:

### Step 1: Outline the Middleware
The middleware will include the following methods:
- **`from_crawler`**: Initialize middleware with settings.
- **`__init__`**: Set up proxy providers and credentials.
- **`process_request`**: Add proxies to requests.
- Helper methods like `api_key_valid` and `add_proxy` will keep the code clean.

### Step 2: Setup Proxies on Launch
During initialization:
1. Load proxy provider API keys from `settings.py`.
2. Define credentials (`username`, `password`, and `host`) for each proxy provider.
3. Create an `api_key_valid` method to validate API keys before sending requests.

### Step 3: Add Proxy to Requests
Define the `add_proxy` method:
- Use the `username`, `password`, and `host` of the selected proxy.
- Apply the proxy to the `Request` object.
- Import the `base64` library to encode user credentials.

### Step 4: Architect the Proxy Waterfall
The proxy waterfall system will follow this logic:
1. Use [ScraperAPI](https://www.scraperapi.com/?fp_ref=coupons) for Google requests (no extra charge for Google scraping).
2. Start with no proxy for cost-saving when scraping non-Google websites.
3. Use Scrapingdog for the first two retries.
4. Switch to ScraperAPI for the 3rd and 4th retries.
5. Use ScrapingBee for all subsequent retries.

If a proxy isnâ€™t enabled (e.g., no API key), the middleware automatically falls back to the next proxy in the sequence.

## Integrating the Proxy Waterfall Middleware into Scrapy

To enable the middleware:
1. **Update `settings.py`:**
   - Add your proxy provider API keys.
   - Include the middleware in the `DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES` setting.
2. Run your Scrapy spider. The middleware will route requests through the configured proxy waterfall, selecting the best proxy based on your criteria.

## Benefits of Proxy Waterfalling

- **Cost Efficiency**: Minimize reliance on expensive proxies by using free or cheaper alternatives whenever possible.
- **Enhanced Reliability**: Ensure uninterrupted scraping by falling back to more reliable proxies.
- **Flexibility**: Customize the system to handle different proxies for different websites or requests.
