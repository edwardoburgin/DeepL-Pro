# What is Googlebot and How Does It Work?

## Introduction

Googlebot is the web crawler that Google uses to collect data and build its web index. It functions in both mobile and desktop modes and has specialized crawlers for tasks like fetching news, images, and videos. 

Additionally, [Google has other crawlers for specific purposes](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/crawling/overview-google-crawlers). Each crawler has a unique "user agent" string to identify itself. Googlebot always stays up-to-date, meaning it views websites similarly to how users would in the latest version of Chrome.

Operating across thousands of machines, Googlebot independently determines what content to crawl and how quickly to do so, ensuring it doesn't overload a website.

## How Googlebot Crawls and Indexes the Web

Google has shared several versions of its crawling and indexing processes over time. Here's the latest workflow:

1. **URL Collection**: Google starts with a list of URLs gathered from various sources, such as pages, sitemaps, RSS feeds, and URLs submitted via Google Search Console or the [Indexing API](https://ahrefs.com/blog/zh/googlebot/).
   
2. **Prioritization**: URLs are prioritized, and Googlebot fetches and stores copies of pages.

3. **Additional Resources**: Google identifies further links to crawl, including APIs, JavaScript, and CSS files necessary to render pages. These resources are also cached and rendered.

4. **Rendering and Storage**: Cached resources are used to render pages as users would see them, and the content is stored in Google's index for search.

5. **Re-crawling**: Googlebot revisits previously crawled pages to check for updates or new links, which are added to the "URL bucket" for future crawling.

## Controlling Googlebot

Google provides several ways to control what it crawls and indexes.

### Methods to Control Crawling

- **[Robots.txt](https://ahrefs.com/blog/zh/robots-txt/)**: This file specifies what parts of your site search engines can or cannot crawl.  
- **[Nofollow](https://ahrefs.com/blog/zh/nofollow-links/)**: A link attribute or meta tag suggesting search engines not to follow links. However, this is merely a recommendation and may be ignored.  
- **[Adjust Crawl Rate](https://ahrefs.com/blog/zh/crawl-budget/#crawl-slower)**: Tools in [Google Search Console](https://ahrefs.com/blog/zh/google-search-console/) allow you to reduce Googlebot's crawl speed.

### Methods to Control Indexing

- **Remove Content**: Deleting a page removes it from indexing. However, users may encounter an empty page.  
- **Restrict Access**: Password-protect or authenticate pages to block Google's access.  
- **[Noindex](https://ahrefs.com/blog/meta-robots/)**: Use the "noindex" directive in meta robots tags to prevent a page from being indexed.  
- **[URL Removal Tool](https://ahrefs.com/blog/zh/googlebot/)**: Temporarily hide pages from search results while Googlebot continues to crawl them.  
- **Block Images via Robots.txt**: Prevent Googlebot from indexing specific images.

For guidance on which method to use, refer to our [flowchart for removing URLs from Google Search](https://ahrefs.com/blog/zh/remove-urls-from-google/).

## How to Verify a Genuine Googlebot

Many SEO tools and malicious bots disguise themselves as Googlebot to access restricted sites. Here's how to verify authenticity:

1. **IP Verification**: Use Google's [public IP list](https://ahrefs.com/blog/zh/googlebot/) to confirm requests originate from Google. Compare this list with your server logs.  
2. **Google Search Console**: Navigate to "Settings" > "Crawl Stats" to access reports on Googlebot activity, such as which files were crawled and when.

## Interesting Facts

Googlebot often gets referred to as a "bot," and its mascot, **Crawley**, resembles a spiderâ€”a nod to its web-crawling role.
