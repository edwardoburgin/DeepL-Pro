Many users struggle to search keywords effectively in certain browsers. For example:

- **Google Chrome**: Use the `Ctrl+F` shortcut to find keywords on a page. However, the default highlight color is a faint yellow, which might be hard to notice.
- **Opera**: Offers a better user experience by darkening the background and using brighter highlights for keywords.
