## How to Use TS-Walmart-Scraper

The scraper accepts a JSON input file named `INPUT.json`, which should be placed in the following directory:  
`project_folder\storage\key_value_stores\default\`.

### Example JSON Input File

The `INPUT.json` file must include the following fields:

- **`productUrls`**: An array of specific product page URLs to scrape.
- **`listingUrls`**: An array of category or brand page URLs to scrape (includes product listings and pagination).
- **`keywords`**: An array of search keywords for Walmart.com.
- **`maxPrice`**: The maximum price range for products to scrape.
- **`minPrice`**: The minimum price range for products to scrape.
- **`startPageNumber`**: The page number to start scraping from.
- **`finalPageNumber`**: The page number to stop scraping at.

### Special Notes:
- Set `minPrice` and `maxPrice` to `0` to scrape products across all price ranges.
- Set `startPageNumber` and `finalPageNumber` to `0` to scrape all available pages.

### Run the Scraper

Once your `INPUT.json` file is ready, run the scraper using the following command:

```bash
npm start
